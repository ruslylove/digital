    % Memory/Logic to Output Interface
    % The prompt implies logic generates "Detected" or "Match" signal first, then modulated
    % Or maybe Q connects to it? Let's assume Logic generates a "Match" signal based on state
    % But wait, "Left Box... contains Output Logic". So Logic -> Match -> Right Box.
    % However, the diagram in Mini Project usually shows Q going to Output Logic.
    % Let's stick to the prompt: "Left Box contains Next-State Logic and Output Logic".
    % So the 'Output Logic' inside the cloud generates the 'Match' condition.
    % Does 'Match' go to Right Box? Yes.
    
    % Let's draw a line from Logic to Right Box, passing *over* Memory or through?
    % A cleaner way: The "Output Logic" part of the Left Box is conceptually what drives the output.
    % But physically, usually Q drives the output decoder. 
    % Let's assume the "Output Logic" is distinct enough to send a signal to the Right Box.
    % OR, maybe the Logic block sends "Match" to the Right Box.
    
    % Alternative interpretation: The "Left Box" is *physically* the combinational chips. 
    % So it takes Q as input. 
    % Let's draw a connection from Logic to Output Interface? 
    % Or simply Q -> Output Interface? 
    % Ref: "Right Box... Handles Detected signal generation". 
    % Ref: "Left Box... Output Logic".
    % This implies: Q -> Left Box (Output Logic) -> Match Signal -> Right Box.
    % This would look messy if Left Box is on the left.
    
    % Let's try to arrange: Logic (Left), Memory (Middle), Output (Right).
    % If Logic generates Match, it has to pass through/around Memory?
    % Maybe the "Output Logic" is a separate block physically, but classified as "Left Box"?
    % Let's clarify the feedback loop first. Logic -> D -> Memory -> Q -> Logic.
    % AND Memory -> Q -> output_interface?
    % If "Output Logic" is in Left Box, maybe it's purely Next State Logic + Mealy/Moore Output decoding?
    % If Moore: Output depends on Q. Q -> Logic -> Match.
    % If Mealy: Output depends on Q + Inputs.
    % Let's assume Moore/Mealy combo.
    % Connection: Capture "Match" from logic? 
    % Let's draw: Memory -> Output Interface (Q bus). This is standard.
    % Then Output Interface contains "Logic" to detect specific state?
    % BUT prompt says "Left Box" contains "Output Logic".
    % Let's compromise: Draw a "Match" line from the Logic Cloud appearing to go to the Right Box.
    % Better: The Feedback path (Q) is available to everyone.
    % Let's tap off the Feedback path to the Right Box.

<div class="text-sm">

### 1. Computer Architecture
*   **Focus:** Pipelining, Caches, Virtual Memory, Out-of-Order Execution.
*   **Key Text:** *Computer Organization and Design* (Patterson & Hennessy) - RISC-V Edition.
*   **Goal:** Build a high-performance CPU (e.g., 5-stage pipeline).

### 2. Advanced FPGA Design
*   **Focus:** SystemVerilog, Timing Analysis, High-Speed Interfaces (PCIe, DDR).
*   **Tools:** Vivado, Quartus Prime Pro.
*   **Goal:** Design complex accelerators and SoCs.

### 3. Embedded Systems
*   **Focus:** Integrating Hardware & Software. Microcontrollers (ARM Cortex-M), RTOS, Drivers.
*   **Project:** Write a C driver for your EC-1/EC-2 or a Nios II/MicroBlaze soft-core.

### 4. VLSI Design (ASIC)
*   **Focus:** Transistor-level design, Standard Cells, Place & Route.
*   **Goal:** Tape out a physical chip.
*   **Tools:** Cadence, Synopsys (Industry Standard).
